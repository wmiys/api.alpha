**********************************************************************************************
A product availability record represents a lender provided date range that they do not wish for
their product to be available for rent. 

So renters will not be able to see the product in the search results if their start/end date range
conflicts with any product availability record.

Furthermore, products that have conflicting availability records will not be able to even receive 
requests from renters if the starts/ends range conflicts.
